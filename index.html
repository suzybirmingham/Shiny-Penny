                <h3>I'm a lifelong knitter, crafter, and <strong>maker</strong></h3>

                <p>At a young age, my mom instilled in me the importance and joy of making things. All of our birthday cards and Valentine's were homemade. As a teenager I learned to knit and was instantly hooked! To this day, I always have a project (or two) going. I have even dabbled in sculpture, collage, and painting. If you know me, at one time or another I have made you something.</p>

                <h3>I'm a master <strong>chef</strong> (in my household of two)</h3>

                <p>To me, cooking is just another way I express myself. The creative process begins when I make my grocery list and doesn't end until the plates are on the table. I take even the simplest of meals seriously. Toast must be perfectly toasted and evenly buttered to each edge. The yolk in a soft-boiled egg must be warm and runny. I always hold my breath a little before the first bite and savor the relief when everything has come out just right. </p>

                <h3>And I'm teaching myself how to <strong>code</strong></h3>

                <p>After working for an early stage startup, I discovered that one of the most vital skills I lacked and <em>more importantly wanted to have</em>, was the ability to code. I am, by nature, a do-it-yourselfer, so I bought a few texts, sat at my computer, and started to learn. I don't know where coding will take me, but I'm really excited to find out. Each day offers a new puzzle to solve and I adore puzzles!</p>
